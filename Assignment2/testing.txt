sent_start ‘After that,’ continued the Hatter, ‘I cut some more bread-and-butter--’

‘But what did the Dormouse say?’ one of the jury asked. sent_end sent_start ‘That I can’t remember,’ said the Hatter. sent_end sent_start ‘You MUST remember,’ remarked the King, ‘or I’ll have you executed.’

The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. sent_end sent_start ‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ he began. sent_end sent_start ‘You’re a very poor speaker,’ said the King. sent_end sent_start Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. sent_end sent_start (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. sent_end sent_start They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.) sent_end sent_start ‘I’m glad I’ve seen that done,’ thought Alice. sent_end sent_start ‘I’ve so often read
in the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts
at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.’

‘If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,’ continued the
King. sent_end sent_start ‘I can’t go no lower,’ said the Hatter: ‘I’m on the floor, as it is.’

‘Then you may SIT down,’ the King replied. sent_end sent_start Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed. sent_end sent_start ‘Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!’ thought Alice. sent_end sent_start ‘Now we shall get
on better.’

‘I’d rather finish my tea,’ said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the
Queen, who was reading the list of singers. sent_end sent_start ‘You may go,’ said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on. sent_end sent_start ‘--and just take his head off outside,’ the Queen added to one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door. sent_end sent_start ‘Call the next witness!’ said the King. sent_end sent_start The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. sent_end sent_start She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once. sent_end sent_start ‘Give your evidence,’ said the King. sent_end sent_start ‘Shan’t,’ said the cook. sent_end sent_start The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
‘Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.’

‘Well, if I must, I must,’ the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, ‘What are tarts made of?’

‘Pepper, mostly,’ said the cook. sent_end sent_start ‘Treacle,’ said a sleepy voice behind her. sent_end sent_start ‘Collar that Dormouse,’ the Queen shrieked out. sent_end sent_start ‘Behead that Dormouse! sent_end sent_start Turn that Dormouse out of court! sent_end sent_start Suppress him! sent_end sent_start Pinch him! sent_end sent_start Off with his
whiskers!’

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared. sent_end sent_start ‘Never mind!’ said the King, with an air of great relief. sent_end sent_start ‘Call the next
witness.’ And he added in an undertone to the Queen, ‘Really, my dear,
YOU must cross-examine the next witness. sent_end sent_start It quite makes my forehead
ache!’

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
curious to see what the next witness would be like, ‘--for they haven’t
got much evidence YET,’ she said to herself. sent_end sent_start Imagine her surprise, when
the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the
name ‘Alice!’




CHAPTER XII. sent_end sent_start Alice’s Evidence


‘Here!’ cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish
she had accidentally upset the week before. sent_end sent_start ‘Oh, I BEG your pardon!’ she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea
that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
they would die. sent_end sent_start ‘The trial cannot proceed,’ said the King in a very grave voice, ‘until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,’ he repeated with
great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do. sent_end sent_start Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. sent_end sent_start She soon got
it out again, and put it right; ‘not that it signifies much,’ she said
to herself; ‘I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial
one way up as the other.’

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court. sent_end sent_start ‘What do you know about this business?’ the King said to Alice. sent_end sent_start ‘Nothing,’ said Alice. sent_end sent_start ‘Nothing WHATEVER?’ persisted the King. sent_end sent_start ‘Nothing whatever,’ said Alice. sent_end sent_start ‘That’s very important,’ the King said, turning to the jury. sent_end sent_start They were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit
interrupted: ‘UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,’ he said in a
very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke. sent_end sent_start ‘UNimportant, of course, I meant,’ the King hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,

‘important--unimportant--unimportant--important--’ as if he were trying
which word sounded best. sent_end sent_start Some of the jury wrote it down ‘important,’ and some ‘unimportant.’
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
‘but it doesn’t matter a bit,’ she thought to herself. sent_end sent_start At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, cackled out ‘Silence!’ and read out from his book, ‘Rule
Forty-two. sent_end sent_start ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.’

Everybody looked at Alice. sent_end sent_start ‘I’M not a mile high,’ said Alice. sent_end sent_start ‘You are,’ said the King. sent_end sent_start ‘Nearly two miles high,’ added the Queen. sent_end sent_start ‘Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,’ said Alice: ‘besides, that’s not a
regular rule: you invented it just now.’

‘It’s the oldest rule in the book,’ said the King. sent_end sent_start ‘Then it ought to be Number One,’ said Alice. sent_end sent_start The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. sent_end sent_start ‘Consider your
verdict,’ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice. sent_end sent_start ‘There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,’ said the White
Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; ‘this paper has just been picked
up.’

‘What’s in it?’ said the Queen. sent_end sent_start ‘I haven’t opened it yet,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘but it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.’

‘It must have been that,’ said the King, ‘unless it was written to
nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.’

‘Who is it directed to?’ said one of the jurymen. sent_end sent_start ‘It isn’t directed at all,’ said the White Rabbit; ‘in fact, there’s
nothing written on the OUTSIDE.’ He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and
added ‘It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.’

‘Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?’ asked another of the jurymen. sent_end sent_start ‘No, they’re not,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘and that’s the queerest thing
about it.’ (The jury all looked puzzled.) sent_end sent_start ‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the King. sent_end sent_start (The jury
all brightened up again.) sent_end sent_start ‘Please your Majesty,’ said the Knave, ‘I didn’t write it, and they
can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.’

‘If you didn’t sign it,’ said the King, ‘that only makes the matter
worse. sent_end sent_start You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your
name like an honest man.’

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day. sent_end sent_start ‘That PROVES his guilt,’ said the Queen. sent_end sent_start ‘It proves nothing of the sort!’ said Alice. sent_end sent_start ‘Why, you don’t even know
what they’re about!’

‘Read them,’ said the King. sent_end sent_start The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. sent_end sent_start ‘Where shall I begin, please
your Majesty?’ he asked. sent_end sent_start ‘Begin at the beginning,’ the King said gravely, ‘and go on till you
come to the end: then stop.’

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--

   ‘They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
   She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim. sent_end sent_start He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
   If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you? sent_end sent_start I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
   They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before. sent_end sent_start If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
   He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were. sent_end sent_start My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
   An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it. sent_end sent_start Don’t let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
   A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.’

‘That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,’ said the
King, rubbing his hands; ‘so now let the jury--’

‘If any one of them can explain it,’ said Alice, (she had grown so large
in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting
him,) ‘I’ll give him sixpence. sent_end sent_start _I_ don’t believe there’s an atom of
meaning in it.’

The jury all wrote down on their slates, ‘SHE doesn’t believe there’s an
atom of meaning in it,’ but none of them attempted to explain the paper. sent_end sent_start ‘If there’s no meaning in it,’ said the King, ‘that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. sent_end sent_start And yet I don’t know,’
he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them
with one eye; ‘I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. sent_end sent_start “--SAID
I COULD NOT SWIM--” you can’t swim, can you?’ he added, turning to the
Knave. sent_end sent_start The Knave shook his head sadly. sent_end sent_start ‘Do I look like it?’ he said. sent_end sent_start (Which he
certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.) sent_end sent_start ‘All right, so far,’ said the King, and he went on muttering over
the verses to himself: ‘“WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--” that’s the jury, of
course--“I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--” why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know--’

‘But, it goes on “THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,”’ said Alice. sent_end sent_start ‘Why, there they are!’ said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts
on the table. sent_end sent_start ‘Nothing can be clearer than THAT. sent_end sent_start Then again--“BEFORE SHE
HAD THIS FIT--” you never had fits, my dear, I think?’ he said to the
Queen. sent_end sent_start ‘Never!’ said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
as she spoke. sent_end sent_start (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as
it lasted.) sent_end sent_start ‘Then the words don’t FIT you,’ said the King, looking round the court
with a smile. sent_end sent_start There was a dead silence. sent_end sent_start ‘It’s a pun!’ the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,
‘Let the jury consider their verdict,’ the King said, for about the
twentieth time that day. sent_end sent_start ‘No, no!’ said the Queen. sent_end sent_start ‘Sentence first--verdict afterwards.’

‘Stuff and nonsense!’ said Alice loudly. sent_end sent_start ‘The idea of having the
sentence first!’

‘Hold your tongue!’ said the Queen, turning purple. sent_end sent_start ‘I won’t!’ said Alice. sent_end sent_start ‘Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. sent_end sent_start Nobody
moved. sent_end sent_start ‘Who cares for you?’ said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this
time.) sent_end sent_start ‘You’re nothing but a pack of cards!’

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. sent_end sent_start ‘Wake up, Alice dear!’ said her sister; ‘Why, what a long sleep you’ve
had!’

‘Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!’ said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures
of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had
finished, her sister kissed her, and said, ‘It WAS a curious dream,
dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.’ So
Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been. sent_end sent_start But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her
wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and
this was her dream:--

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking
up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to
listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
of her little sister’s dream. sent_end sent_start The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle. sent_end sent_start So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she
knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing
of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle’s
heavy sobs. sent_end sent_start Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and
make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even
with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with
all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days. sent_end sent_start THE END
